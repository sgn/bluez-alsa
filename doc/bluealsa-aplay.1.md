# NAME

bluealsa-aplay - a simple bluealsa player

# SYNOPSIS

**bluealsa-aplay** [*OPTION*]... [*BT-ADDR*]...

# DESCRIPTION

Capture audio streams from Bluetooth devices (via **bluealsa**(8)) and play them to an ALSA
playback device.

By default **bluealsa-aplay** captures audio from all connected Bluetooth devices.
It is possible to select specific Bluetooth devices by providing a list of *BT-ADDR* MAC
addresses.
Using the special MAC address **00:00:00:00:00:00** will disable device filtering - the
same as the default behavior.

# OPTIONS

**-h**, **\--help**
:   Output a usage message and exit.

**-V**, **\--version**
:   Output the version number and exit.

**-v**, **\--verbose**
:   Make the output more verbose.

**-l**, **\--list-devices**
:   List connected Bluetooth audio devices.

**-L**, **\--list-pcms**
:   List available Bluetooth audio PCMs on connected devices.

**-B**, **\--dbus**=*NAME*
:   BlueALSA service name suffix.
    For more information see **\--dbus**=*NAME* option of **bluealsa**(8) service
    daemon.

**-D**, **\--pcm**=*NAME*
:   Select ALSA playback PCM device to use for audio output. The default is "default".

**\--pcm-buffer-time**=*INT*
:   Set the playback PCM buffer duration time to *INT* microseconds.
    The default is 500000.
    ALSA may choose the nearest available alternative if the requested value is
    not supported.

**\--pcm-period-time**=*INT*
:   Set the playback PCM period duration time to *INT* microseconds.
    The default is 100000.
    ALSA may choose the nearest available alternative if the requested value is
    not supported.

**\--profile-a2dp**
:   Use A2DP profile (default).

**\--profile-sco**
:   Use SCO profile.

**\--single-audio**
:   Allow only one Bluetooth device to play audio at a time.
    Without this option, **bluealsa-aplay** plays audio from all selected Bluetooth devices.
    Please note that playing from all Bluetooth devices at a time requires used PCM to be able
    to mix audio from multiple sources (i.e., it can be opened more than once; for
    example the ALSA **dmix** plugin).
